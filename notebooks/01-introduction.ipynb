    "Welcome to your LangGraph journey! In this notebook, you'll learn the fundamentals of LangGraph and build your first graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is LangGraph?\n",
    "\n",
    "LangGraph is a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs. It's built on top of LangChain and adds the ability to create cyclical graphs, which are essential for agent-like behaviors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Nodes**: Functions that do the work\n",
    "2. **Edges**: Connections between nodes\n",
    "3. **State**: Data that flows through the graph\n",
    "4. **Graph**: The overall structure that orchestrates everything\n",
    "\n",
    "## Setup\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's install the required packages and set up our environment."
